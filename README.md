# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

During the project I learened how to use github freely, commit any changes I have made to my project, and fix any potentials bugs on the way. My main motivation was not to get discouraged whenever facing any hurdles and learn how to overcome any issues I might face. The reason why I build this project was to be able to use all the tools required for coding at my disposal, allowing me to adapt quicker to a professional coding work environment.
